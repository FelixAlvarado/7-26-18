what re the steps for the BFS on a graph? 

start with the starting node 
then search all of that nodes children if they have not been visited 
with each search you put each of the children in the queue and in order 
check for visitation 
put nodes children in queue 
remove current node from queue 
all of this is done until queue is empty

why do we need a DNS?
Domain Name system 
DNS tranlates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources. 
"phonebook of internet"
